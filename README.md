# RepoMarket â€“ Code Sharing and Purchasing with Admin Control

## Project Overview
**RepoMarket** is a Flutter-based platform that allows developers to upload project files, where only admins can view and manage these files. The platform includes a system for companies to view a project's README file, assess the project, and, if interested, purchase the project files. This project ensures a secure environment for code sharing, file management, and role-based access control.

## Key Features
1. **File Upload by Users:**
   - Users can upload project files (such as ZIP archives) that only admins can access.
   - The project files are securely stored in cloud storage (Firebase Storage or AWS S3).

2. **README File Visibility:**
   - A README file is either uploaded by users or generated by the platform, which is visible to companies to evaluate projects.
   - Companies can review the README before purchasing the project file.

3. **Admin Dashboard:**
   - Admins can view and manage all uploaded project files.
   - Admins have the ability to approve or reject projects for listing in the marketplace.

4. **Company Dashboard:**
   - Companies can view README files for projects they are interested in.
   - Companies can purchase project files, gaining access to download the files after successful payment.

5. **Role-based Access Control:**
   - Three user roles: `User`, `Admin`, and `Company`.
   - Each role has distinct permissions and access levels within the platform.

6. **Purchasing System:**
   - Integration with payment gateways such as Stripe or Razorpay to handle purchases.
   - After payment, company members are granted access to download the full project files.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** Flutter
- **Backend:**
  - Firebase (Firestore, Storage) for file storage and user management
  - Custom REST API for handling file uploads, project listings, and purchases (Optional)
- **Payments:** Stripe / Razorpay for handling purchases
- **Authentication:** Firebase Authentication for user login and role management
- **Database:** Firebase Firestore or an alternative cloud database for storing project data, user roles, and purchase records.

## Installation and Setup
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vishnu8299/repo_market.git
   cd repo_market
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Ensure that you have Flutter and Dart installed, then run:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Configure Firebase:**
   - Set up Firebase for the project. Follow the Firebase setup guide to configure Firebase Authentication, Firestore, and Storage.
   - Add the `google-services.json` file (for Android) and `GoogleService-Info.plist` (for iOS) to the respective folders.

4. **Run the Application:**
   You can run the application using:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## File Upload and README Management
- **User File Upload:**
  Users can upload project files (e.g., ZIP format) via the file picker, and the files will be stored in Firebase Storage.
  
- **README File:**
  Users can either upload a README file as part of their project or input README content directly in the app's form.

## Role-Based Access Control
- **Admin Access:**
  Admins can view all uploaded files, approve or reject projects, and download the project files.
  
- **Company Access:**
  Companies can only view README files and have the option to purchase project files. Once a project is purchased, they can download the project file from their dashboard.

## Payment Integration
- The app integrates with **Stripe** or **Razorpay** for payment processing.
- Once a payment is successful, the company is granted access to download the purchased project file.

## Data Privacy and Security
- Files are stored securely in cloud storage with access control to ensure that only authorized users (admins or company members post-purchase) can access files.
- User data is protected in compliance with GDPR and other relevant privacy laws.
- Transactions are securely handled through trusted payment gateways, ensuring secure financial transactions.

## Legal Considerations
- **Data Privacy Compliance:** Compliant with GDPR, CCPA, and other data protection regulations.
- **Intellectual Property (IP) Protection:** Projects uploaded by users remain their property unless explicitly transferred in a sale agreement. Clear terms and conditions govern the use and purchase of projects.

## Future Enhancements
- Add automated malware and content moderation checks for uploaded files.
- Implement support for project version control and updates.
- Expand payment methods to include PayPal and cryptocurrency.
- Add notifications for admins and companies for new uploads and purchases.
